#+TITLE: My Nix Profile

My [[https://github.com/lambdadog/nix-profile-declarative][nix-profile-declarative]] configuration. Doesn't use
~nix-profile-declarative~ as a channel due to my consistent dogfooding
of my changes to the project, but shows what a reasonable config may
look like.

I imagine you'll rarely see modules for nixpkgs packages added to this
repository, since it'll often make more sense to clean them up and add
them to ~nix-profile-declarative~ itself, but at the same time it's
not impossible for more messy modules to appear before being migrated
over.
